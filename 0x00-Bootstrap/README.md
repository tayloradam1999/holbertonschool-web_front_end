# Learning Bootstrap, a free and open source front end development framework.  

> Quick note: For nearly every task of this project, we are given HTML files that are rather lengthy, and I am not able to find a way to share the code given to us using Markdown. Instead of laying out the directions that are given to us per task, I will provide a brief description of what each task is asking us to do later in this README instead.  

## Resources  
- [Bootstrap](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/II-u9lliwceVN22GaMLfmA)  
  
## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/v8AsBqDPcmZA5MKRkNRJRg), **without the help of Google:**  
- Usage of Containers  
- Usage of the Grid system  
- Usage of Components  
- Usage of Utilities  
  
## Requirements  
- A ```README.md``` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory  
- Use Bootstrap version ```4.4.1```  
  

## Use the CDN version  
Add this ```<link>``` in the ```<head>``` part of your HTML file:  
  
```<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.4.1/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-Vkoo8x4CGsO3+Hhxv8T/Q5PaXtkKtu6ug5TOeNV6gBiFeWPGFN9MuhOf23Q9Ifjh" crossorigin="anonymous">```  
  
## Task 0: Reboot styling  
In this task, we are given an HTML file and are asked to rewrite the styling using Bootstrap.

## Task 1: Blocks  
**Requirements:**  
- You are not allow to define any styling in a CSS file, in head or inline - only Bootstrap classes  
- You can not change the HTML structure - only adding classes is allowed  
  
This task provides us with an HTML file that renders several different containers. The task asks us to implement Bootstrap so that when we lower the width of our device, the containers react and are placed per the tasks restrictions and requirements.

## Task 2: Table of chemical elements  
**Requirements:**  
- You are not allow to define any styling in a CSS file, in head or inline - only Bootstrap classes  
- You can not change the HTML structure - only adding classes is allowed  
  
This task provides us with an HTML file that renders a table of chemical elements. All the tasks has us do is implement Bootstrap so that the rendered table scales sufficiently to the device size selected.

## Task 3: Cards  
**Requirements:**  
- You are not allow to define any styling in a CSS file, in head or inline - only Bootstrap classes  
- You can not change the HTML structure - only adding classes is allowed  

This task provides us with a raw html file and has us implement bootstrap classes to position all of the divs correctly. This task also introduces us to JS modals!

## Task 4: Bob Dylan  
**Requirements:**  
- You are not allow to define any styling in a CSS file, in head or inline - only Bootstrap classes  
- You can not change the HTML structure - only adding classes is allowed
  
This task provides us with another raw html file and has us implement more bootstrap classes. The tasks are starting to give us **LITTLE TO NO DIRECTION**, so from what I can see, this task will have us working with drop down links/menus. Basically, all I have to go off of are these jpgs and gifs :)

## Task 5: Show/Hide - screen size  
**Requirements:**  
- You are not allow to define any styling in a CSS file, in head or inline - only Bootstrap classes  
- You can not change the HTML structure - only adding classes is allowed  
  
This task gives us a very short HTML file being only around 20 lines long. The goal of this task is to learn how to display/hide divs and text at certain breakpoints. This tasks also touches a little more on changing the width of containers at certain breakpoints, too.

## Task 6: Overwrite CSS
