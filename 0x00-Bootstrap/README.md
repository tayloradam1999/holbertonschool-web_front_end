# Learning Bootstrap, a free and open source front end development framework.  

> Quick note: For nearly every task of this project, we are given HTML files that are rather lengthy, and I am not able to find a way to share the code given to us using Markdown. Instead of laying out the directions that are given to us per task, I will provide a brief description of what each task is asking us to do later in this README instead.  

## Resources  
- [Bootstrap](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/II-u9lliwceVN22GaMLfmA)  
  
## Learning Objectives
- At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to [explain to anyone](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/v8AsBqDPcmZA5MKRkNRJRg), **without the help of Google:**  
- Usage of Containers  
- Usage of the Grid system  
- Usage of Components  
- Usage of Utilities  
  
## Requirements  
- A ```README.md``` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory  
- Use Bootstrap version ```4.4.1```  
  

## Use the CDN version  
Add this ```<link>``` in the ```<head>``` part of your HTML file:  
  
```<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.4.1/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-Vkoo8x4CGsO3+Hhxv8T/Q5PaXtkKtu6ug5TOeNV6gBiFeWPGFN9MuhOf23Q9Ifjh" crossorigin="anonymous">```  
  
## Task 0: Reboot styling  
In this task, we are given an HTML file and are asked to rewrite the styling using Bootstrap.

## Task 1: Blocks  
**Requirements:**  
- You are not allow to define any styling in a CSS file, in head or inline - only Bootstrap classes  
- You can not change the HTML structure - only adding classes is allowed  
  
This task provides us with an HTML file that renders several different containers. The task asks us to implement Bootstrap so that when we lower the width of our device, the containers react and are placed per the tasks restrictions and requirements.

## Task 2: Table of chemical elements  
**Requirements:**  
- You are not allow to define any styling in a CSS file, in head or inline - only Bootstrap classes  
- You can not change the HTML structure - only adding classes is allowed  
This task provides us with an HTML file that renders a table of chemical elements. All the tasks has us do is implement Bootstrap so that the rendered table scales sufficiently to the device size selected.
